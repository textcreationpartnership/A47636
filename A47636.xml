            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Occaſion of our preſent Meeting is to inquire into the reaſons of ſetting apart and keeping certain days for the more ſpecial Worſhip of God; which are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore call'd Holy; and into the reaſons why they are no better kept. The former I ſhall chiefly ſpeak to from the words now read; which the Jews underſtand of the Day of <hi>David's</hi> advancement to the Throne; and accordingly the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſt renders the 22th. <hi>ver.</hi> thus, The Builders deſpiſed the Youth that was among the Sons of <hi>Jeſſe,</hi> and yet he deſerv'd to be made King and Ruler; and then brings in the Builders and the Sons of <hi>Jeſſe</hi> with others ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>alternatim</hi> thus; the Builders begin, <hi>This is the Lords doing;</hi> the Sons of <hi>Jeſſe</hi> anſwer, <hi>It is marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous in our eyes:</hi> The Builders go on, <hi>This is the day which the Lord hath made;</hi> the Sons of <hi>Jeſſe, Let us rejoyce and be glad in it:</hi> The Builders again, <hi>Save now we beſeech thee, O Lord;</hi> then <hi>Jeſſe</hi> and his Wife, <hi>O Lord we beſeech thee ſend now proſperity;</hi> and laſtly, <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Samuel</hi> and the whole Tribe of <hi>Judah</hi> are brought in bearing their parts in this Pſalm of Thanksgiving. And they had good reaſon to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:97959:4"/>the Day ſpoken of, to be the Day of <hi>David's</hi> coming to the Crown; but we have greater, to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it of the Day of our Lord's Reſurrection from the dead; which was the Day whereon he began his Reign or the exerciſe of his Kingly Office. For our Lord appropriates to himſelf thoſe words of the 22d. <hi>ver. The ſtone which the Builders refus'd is become the head of the Corner,</hi> Matt. 21.42. adding alſo the words of the 23. <hi>ver.</hi> and St. <hi>Peter</hi> (himſelf a great ſtone in that Building) applies the ſame to our Lord after and upon account of his Reſurrection. <hi>Act.</hi> 4.11. 1 <hi>Epiſtle</hi> 2.4. To which add the Hoſanna and Benediction of the two following verſes, which were the Acclamations of the multitude, when our Lord rode in Kinglike manner to <hi>Jeruſalem, Matt.</hi> 21.5, 9.</p>
            <p>We have in the words, the Conſtitution of a Holy or Feſtival day, and the Celebration of it.</p>
            <p>The Conſtitution, <hi>This is the day which the Lord hath made.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Celebration, <hi>We will rejoyce and be glad in it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, For the Conſtitution: Here is the ground and reaſon for the ordaining and keeping of a Day Holy; becauſe it is that which the Lord hath made; where by making, 1. We don't underſtand the creating of a Day, which is done by dividing the Darkneſs from the Light; for ſo all days are of Gods making, and made without any diſtinction of <hi>Feſti &amp; Profeſti, Faſti &amp; Nefaſti,</hi> Holy and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy, Lucky and Unlucky, or any other differences than what the courſe of the Sun and the ſeaſons of the year do neceſſarily cauſe. 2. Nor do we underſtand here only Gods appointing of a Day to be kept for Religious purpoſes; for that hath and may be done by man. But</p>
            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:97959:4"/>
            <p>We underſtand thereby the making of a Day ſignal and remarkable by ſome extraordinary deliverance or other Mercy beſtow'd upon Mankind in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, or ſome Nation or great body of Men in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular. Such a Mercy, ſuch a Deliverance leaves a certain ſtamp or impreſſion upon that Day, whereon it was beſtow'd, as to make it be call'd a Holy day, a High day, a day of days, a day more extraordinary and notable than its fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows. Such was the day of <hi>David</hi>'s Exaltation to the Throne, a Day of great Mercy and Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance to the People of Iſrael, and ſuch was the Day of our Lord's Reſurrection, a Day of great Mercy and Deliverance to all mankind. Such Days are, if I may ſo call them, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Days of a ſingular make, and which God hath as it were redeem'd and purchas'd to himſelf from the reſt of the days of the year. Grant me this ground to go upon, and I ſhall hope to give you ſome tolerable account of the Inſtitution of Holy days. What I have to ſay, ſhall be comprehended under a very few Heads.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Upon this ground it is that we hear of no ſpecial Day ſet apart for above two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years, unleſs that of the Sabbath. For altho I doubt not but that, as there were ſome days whereon the Sons of God came to preſent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves before the Lord (as we find twice in <hi>Job,</hi>) ſo there was alſo ſome time whereon the Sons of Men made their Religious addreſſes to Him; And I underſtand, when 'tis ſaid after the birth of <hi>Enos, Then men began to call upon the name of the Lord,</hi> thus, Then men being increaſed into a multitude the Worſhip of God became more publick: Yet, I ſay, we are not ſure, whether the time was fix'd
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:97959:5"/>and unalterable, or whether choſen or command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon occaſion. We read of Holy Perſons or Prieſts of Holy things, as Sacrifices and Tithes, and of Holy places often before the Deliverance out of <hi>Egypt;</hi> but not of Holy times: Altars ſeveral, built by <hi>Noah, Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and ſeveral of them upon the ſcore of Gods appearing to them; when it might have been ſaid to them as it was to <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Joſhua,</hi> upon the ſame ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, The ground whereon thou ſtandeſt is Holy; and, they might have ſaid, as the Pſalmiſt does here of a Day, This is the Place, which the Lord hath made; that is, ſignaliſed by his ſpecial appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in a way of Mercy. But no fix'd times; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God for the firſt Two thouſand years of the World had rather given publick tokens of his Juſtice and Diſpleaſure, than of his Goodneſs and Mercy; as in the drowning of the Old World, the burning of <hi>Sodom</hi> and the three neighbouring Cities, the confounding of Tongues; ſeveral Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines and Plagues. The favours which God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow'd at any time, were only on ſingle Perſons or their Familes; which, although we need not doubt but they did moſt thankfully acknowledge; yet if we grant, they did yearly commemorate the ſame during their own lives, that they did ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blige their Poſterity to do the ſame, we have no ground to think. For, I ſuppoſe, he that finds in an Eaſtern Calendar, exhibited by Mr. <hi>Selden, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſus Noachi in Arcam,</hi> and <hi>Egreſſus Noachi ex Nave,</hi> will not think it ſignifies much againſt what I ſay.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Upon this ground, as ſoon as any other, I would conclude the Sabbath-day was kept from the beginning of the World, in honor
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:97959:5"/>of the great maker of it; and that God by ceaſing from the making of all other things made that a ſignal Day, a Day of Reſt and Joy. For, if at the laying of the foundations of the Earth, <hi>the Morning Stars ſang together, and all the Sons of God ſhouted for joy,</hi> Job 38.7. can we think the Sons of Men were ſilent and ſtupid; when they not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held that great work compleated, but conſtantly injoyed their ſhares therein, and were themſelves no ſmall part of it? So ſtupendious a work de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd to be Celebrated as ſoon as it was finiſh'd, and in that portion of time which God had ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified. And it was ſurely, a greater work to make a World, than to deliver a ſmall People out of a Tyrants hands; and yet this had not only a yearly, but alſo this weekly Commemoration of it. I would, I ſay, upon this ground conclude that of <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.3. to be more than Proleptical; but that there are ſome other reaſons on the other hand, wherein I have not yet ſatisfied my ſelf. But as from ſuch a concluſion the Morality of a Seventh day could not be inferr'd; ſo without ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion we need not doubt our obligation to keep the Chriſtian Sabbath; from this very ground we now go upon, as may be ſeen anon. Wherefore I paſs on, and ſay in the third place.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Upon this ground we ſhall find the Jewiſh Feſtivals to have been founded; as well thoſe that were ordain'd by Men, as thoſe that were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by God himſelf. The chief of Gods own commanding were the weekly Sabbath, and thoſe three that required their yearly attendance in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> All which were commemorative of ſomething paſs'd and Typical of ſomething future; and they all related to the redemption of the Iſraelites out of <hi>Egypt.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:97959:6"/>
            <p n="1">1. The Sabbath-day had that reſpect. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is obſervable that in the <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> (<hi>c.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 15.) the reaſon fetch'd from Gods reſting on the ſeventh day is omitted (the reaſon expreſs'd <hi>Ex.</hi> 20. and ſtill retain'd by us) and this is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted in the room thereof: <hi>Remember that thou waſt a Servant in the Land of</hi> Egypt, <hi>and that the Lord thy God brought thee out thence with a mighty hand, and by an outſtretched arm; therefore the Lord thy God commanded thee to keep the Sabbath-day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. That the Paſſover was therefore alſo command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is ſo notorious, that I need ſay nothing. This was a Feaſt of ſeven days, on the firſt whereof this Deliverance was wrought. <hi>This</hi> (ſays <hi>Ex.</hi> 12.14.) <hi>day ſhall be to you for a Memorial, and ye ſhall keep it a Feaſt to the Lord throughout your generations, ye ſhall keep it a Feaſt by an Ordinance for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. That of Pentecoſt, which was ordain'd in Memory of the giving of the Law; and therefore the Jews call'd it <hi>Feſtum Legis.</hi> A great Bleſſing this was. For though then other Lords had no do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over them, yet Anarchy would have been little better than Tyranny, and their deliverance out of the houſe of Bondage a delivery into a Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs of violence, tumult and confuſion; had they not been afterwards form'd into a Polity, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd certain Laws, Statutes and Judgments, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they ſhould be govern'd both in Religious and Civil affairs, and this was done or began to be done upon the day of Pentecoſt, and this alſo had a ſpecial reference to their Emancipation from Egyptian bondage; according to, <hi>Deut.</hi> 16.10, 12. <hi>Thou ſhalt keep the Feaſt of Weeks unto the Lord thy God, Thou, and thy Son, and thy Servant; and thou
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:97959:6"/>ſhalt remember that thou waſt a Bondman in Egypt.</hi>

            <p n="4">4. The Feaſt of Tabernacles had the like refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, Levit. 23.42, 43. <hi>Ye ſhall dwell in Booths ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven days, that your generations may know that I made the Children of Iſrael to dwell in Booths, when I brought them out of the Land of Egypt, I am the Lord your God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. Add, how the Feaſt of Trumpets call'd a Sabbath, a Memorial of blowing of Trumpets, a Holy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation ſeems to have been ordain'd in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the taking of <hi>Jericho</hi> by the blowing of Trumpets; the taking of which City was the firſt Poſſeſſion the Iſraelites took of the Land of Promiſe, and an earneſt of all the reſt. We need not here diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble what <hi>P. Fagius</hi> tells us, how on the Seventh day of the Feaſt of Tabernacles they went ſeven times round the Altar, in memory of the taking of that City, the City of Palms, bearing Palm-branches in their hands; and indeed of ſuch chiefly they were requir'd to make their Booths, <hi>Lev.</hi> 23.43. It is all one to our purpoſe. But I will not ſtand ſo much on theſe things, nor on the Feaſts that follow, which were of human ordination. As 1. The Feaſt of Purim, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd by <hi>Eſther</hi> and <hi>Mordecai,</hi> and receiv'd by the Jews with general conſent to be remembred and kept throughout every Generation, every Province, every City, every Family in Memorial of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance from the Bloody Conſpiracy of <hi>Haman.</hi> 2. The Feaſt of Dedication; thoſe <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, (which our Lord honour'd with his preſence) ordain'd in memory of the Dedication of the Temple and Altar made by <hi>Judas Maccaboeus</hi> after the horrid Profa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of <hi>Antiochus.</hi> 3. The Feaſt of Fire, which was given from Heaven, when <hi>Nehemiah</hi> offer'd Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice after his building the Temple and the Altar whereof read 2. <hi>Macc.</hi> 1.18, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="8" facs="tcp:97959:7"/>
            <p>Fourthly, Come we now to our Chriſtian Feaſts and to ſhew that the days and times of them were made by God alſo; ſignalis'd and exempt out of the number of common days, by far greater Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and Deliverances, than ever were beſtowed on the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and of more univerſal concern. Theſe are of Gods making rather than Mans; He hath ſet his Seal upon them, and by his own deed plainly pointed out our duty. We in keeping them adore Gods extraordinary Providence in the greateſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagements, that could poſſibly be in order to our wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare. What Man doth in theſe is but his ſealing to the Counterpart of that which God himſelf hath dictated and wrought with his own hand; It is but a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification of his Thankfulneſs, and that is no hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Invention, but a reſult of the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. For the Church of <hi>England</hi> (and I doubt not the like of all other Reformed Churches, which have their Holy days too) hath no other end in appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe days but as they are days of Thanksgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to God; and that, either for thoſe great Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of his Goodneſs, Wiſdom and Power, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr'd to the compleating of the work of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption; Or for thoſe gracious means, whereby the glad Tidings of Salvation have been made known, and become ſaving unto us. 1. For the Myſteries themſelves, the firſt great Myſtery of Godlineſs, or Chriſtian Religion, is God manifeſted in the Fleſh; and this we think our ſelves bound to commemorate on the days of his Incarnation (commonly call'd the <hi>Annunciation</hi>) and of his Nativity. The next is his being Juſtified in the Spirit at his Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and this we Celebrate, as on every Lord's day, ſo eſpecially on that day of the year, whereon he roſe. Then his being receiv'd into Glory on <hi>Aſcenſion</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:97959:7"/>day; his being Preach'd to the Gentiles on the <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phany,</hi> whereto are premis'd and ſubjoyn'd that of the Circumciſion and Preſentment of our Lord in the Temple, to ſhew our hope of the Converſion of the Jews, and that we and they muſt expect to be ſaved by one and the ſame Saviour. 2. Others are in contemplation of the Means whereby ſo great a Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation hath been publiſh'd for the benefit of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. As 1. The Deſcent of the Holy Ghoſt, for which we have our <hi>Whitſunday.</hi> 2. Our Lords be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeen of Angels in order to make them his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtring Spirits, to Miniſter to them that ſhall be Heirs of Salvation; for which we have that of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael</hi> and all Angels. 3. His being believed on in the World, through the Preaching and Writing of the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts, and the means of all thoſe Perſons and Things, whereby ſo great a Myſtery was made credible to the World; as was that of our Lords Birth by the little leſs miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Birth of <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt (the only Saint there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whoſe Nativity we obſerve) and the dreadful Maſſacre of the Fourteen thouſand Infants at <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lehem:</hi> And that of his Reſurrection and Aſcenſion by the aforeſaid Effuſion of the Holy Ghoſt, the death of the Protomartyr <hi>Stephen</hi> (who ſaw our Lord ſtanding at the right hand of God) and all other Saints and Martyrs their Holy lives and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful deaths. And now after all, when the great Creator and Redeemer of Mankind, and Sanctifier of the Elect have been devoutly acknowledged on diſtinct days; If there be one added to recogniſe the Ineffable <hi>Trin-<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> I hope none will gainſay it, though the ground I go upon will not reach it. Ye ſee now our Church hath not ſtuffed her Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendar with the Invention of the Croſs of Chriſt, of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:97959:8"/>the Head of <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> the Bones of St. <hi>Luke,</hi> the Relicks of any other Martyrs, with the Names of ſeign'd or real Saints, that had not a ſpecial Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to Preach the Goſpel, or were not extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary inſtruments to aſſert the Credibility of it. So that our Church Calendar is a kind of Catechiſm, inſtructive even of them that cannot read, where Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly days are duly obſerv'd.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Upon this ground we may build the true degrees and diſtinctions of Holy days. All the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricks are not of an equal dye; there are, if I may ſo ſay, <hi>dies</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, ſcarlet days, <hi>Feſta duplicia, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jora &amp; minora,</hi> as they us'd to ſpeak. God hath left a greater impreſſion and mark upon ſome than upon others, as he did upon the Jewiſh; and as they had, ſo have we upon the ſame ſcore three diſtinctions of Days. And this threefold degree of Holineſs might be made out as well in Perſons and Places, as Times, both in the Jewiſh and Chriſtian Church; but that is alien from our buſineſs.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The Lords day is (as the Sabbath was with them) the Queen and Empreſs of Days; a day which God hath Crown'd more than any other, by extraordinary Acts of his own. 'Tis the firſt day that God made, that whereon he began the Creation of the World, and that whereon our Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Lord finiſh'd the work of our Redemption. It pleads the greateſt Antiquity, as a day ſet apart for all Religious Performances; that whereon our Lord twice viſited his Diſciples, that whereon the Holy Ghoſt deſcended upon them; that whereon St. <hi>Peter</hi> Preach'd and Converted Three thouſand Souls, whereon St. <hi>Paul</hi> gave the Holy Communion and uſed to have his Collections for the Poor; that whereon the Primitive Chriſtians uſed to Pray ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:97959:8"/>and always forbid Faſting. A Day, which the Great <hi>Conſtantine</hi> took care to be wholly devoted to Divine Worſhip, and Chriſtian Inſtruction; on it he caus'd all Courts of Judicature to be ſhut up; all publick Suits and private Arbitrations to be ſuperſeded. The Great <hi>Theodoſius</hi> forbid all publick ſhews and ſpectacles on that Day; The other <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſius</hi> did the like, and moreover provided in caſe the Day of the Birth or Inauguration of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror happen'd on the Lord's day, the ſolemnities uſual in honour of the Imperial Majeſty ſhould be deferr'd till another day. A Day which always, as far as we can find, had the Preheminence in this our Land. Of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Church we have ſcarce any Records; but for our Anteceſſors the <hi>Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> it is demonſtrable, that they, after they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a Chriſtian and ſetled People for above Three Hundred years gave the preference to this above all other Feſtivals, although a certain Hiſtorian hath born us in hand to the contrary. The Laws of King <hi>Ina</hi> and of King <hi>Withred</hi> at the Council of <hi>Berghamſted;</hi> the Canons of the Council of <hi>Clove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhow</hi> or <hi>Cliffe</hi> held under <hi>Cuthbert</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury;</hi> the Excerptions of <hi>Egbert</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>York.</hi> The Laws of King <hi>Alfred</hi> and <hi>Edward</hi> the Elder, in conjunction with <hi>Guthrun</hi> the Dane. The Laws of King <hi>Athelſtan,</hi> King <hi>Edgar</hi> the Peaceable, and King <hi>Ethelred</hi> in a General Council of all <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and King <hi>Kanute;</hi> All take moſt eſpecial care for the obſervance of the Lords day above others; and, if I miſtake not, in one place 'tis call'd The Holy Day. This is plain to any one who conſults that great lover of Church and Clergy, the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Induſtrious Sir <hi>Henry Spelman.</hi> I ſhould not doubt to anſwer the Pompous Arguments that are
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:97959:9"/>brought to the contrary from the times of the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Confuſions, and afterwards; but I hold not my ſelf ſo much bound to account for thoſe times; becauſe if they did reduce the Queen of Days to a common Peerage with the other leſs Holy; it is no more to be wondred at than twenty things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides: For they made the Virgin and other Saints, fellows with our Lord, or rather Superiors in all other Honors. Where one Church was built in Honor of our Lord, there were ten Dedicated to St. <hi>Mary;</hi> ten <hi>Ave-Maries</hi> ſaid for one <hi>Pater-noſter,</hi> and in ſeveral other things, the Mother had ten to one odds of her Son; and Men were grown ſo ſot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh at laſt as with a ſmall diſtinction to allow that <hi>Peter-noſter</hi> might be ſaid to the Mother of our Lord.</p>
            <p>And now let me ſpeak alittle to the Honor of of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as it hath ſtood ever ſince our happy Reformation. Some that have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken good pains to deliver us from the Superſtitious and Judaiſing Doctrines of others about the Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Lords day, have run into another Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme, and levelling that with other Holy days, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titl'd to our Church their own private Perſuaſion. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly our Church intended a difference, when Ordaining the incomparable Litany to be always a part of the Service of the Lord's day, which is only acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally a part of any other Feſtival Service; and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the Solemn recital of the Ten Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the Fourth among them, with the ſame ejaculatory Prayer on the Peoples part, is very tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them to think that our Church had her Eye chiefly on this Day, having told us nothing of her mind to the contrary. Nay, I think, who ever can conſtrue <hi>Engliſh,</hi> will find how in the Homily of the Place and Time of Prayer, the far greateſt ſtreſs
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:97959:9"/>is laid upon this day; and no Comments or Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions have yet evinced the contrary. Add that no Apocryphal Leſſon is appointed for any Lord's day throughout the whole year; but for other Holy days, ſeveral. Add how in the Explications of the ſaid Fourth Commandment in the Catechiſm of King <hi>Edward</hi> VI. and in the Greater Catechiſm ſet forth in the days of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> (which only is allow'd to be taught with the Leſſer by the Canons of 1571. and the Canons of the firſt of King <hi>James</hi>) there is no notice taken of any other but our Lords Day. As for any Statutes made on this behalf (as one or more have been in every Reign of our Reformed Princes) I leave you to the Learned in the Law; obſerving this only, that care hath been taken for the Suppreſſion of all Markets and Fairs on this day.</p>
            <p>And what if, after all this, <hi>Tindall</hi> ſaid, that our Lords Day might be tranſlated from <hi>Sunday</hi> to <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> would have it to <hi>Thurſday,</hi> what is that to our Church? I think they are much miſtaken, if the ground, whereon I build, have any ſolidity in it. <hi>Sunday</hi> is that day on the Week which our Lord hath made, made more ſignal than all the reſt by his Reſurrection from the dead, and raiſing us up from the ſtate of death, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now (my Chriſtian Friends) tell me what harm is done, if the Queen take place of the Ladies of Honor; and they are not at all ſhut out, but admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in their proper orders. For</p>
            <p>Secondly, There is ſome difference to be made, and hath always been between the reſt of the Holy days, though all are Holy. Precedence hath been given eſpecially to thoſe that record ſome Eminent Particularities of our Lords great Undertaking; ſuch as his Nativity, Paſſion, Reſurrection, Aſcenſion and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:97959:10"/>Miſſion of the Holy Ghoſt. Which are too great Myſteries either to be huddled up all in one day, and not Celebrated diſtinctly on ſome peculiar days; or to be no more regarded than the deaths of our fellow-Chriſtians. Three of them have a more than ordinary mark ſet upon them, as they are Antitypes to three Typical Feaſts of the Jews or (if that Phraſe pleaſe not) as they are ſucceſſive to them, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorative of greater Things, which thoſe leſſer Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated by them, did but fore-ſhadow. For</p>
            <p>Firſt, As the Deliverance out of <hi>Egypt</hi> did Typifie, our Redemption from a greater Bondage; ſo the Feaſt kept in memory of the former might juſtly Typifie, or Uſher in, or give ſufficient Intimation for the keeping of a Feaſt in honor of the later, both happening at the ſame time of the Year.</p>
            <p>Secondly, As the Feaſt of Weeks did commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the giving of the Law upon Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> ſo doth our <hi>Whit-Sunday</hi> the publiſhing of the Law of the Spirit or Doctrine of the Goſpel upon Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> in a no leſs extraordinary manner, upon the ſame day; and therefore the later Feaſt deſervedly took place, or came in the room of the former.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, If the Feaſt of Tabernacles did prefigure our Lords Nativity (as the Learned <hi>Mede</hi> not unhappily conjectures) for then the Word was made Fleſh and Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacled among us; then the Feaſt of the Nativity rightly ſucceeds in the room thereof. I will not med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with the contemporiſing thoſe two great Feaſts (much hath been ſaid <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con</hi>) but inſtead thereof, ask how or when that Prophecy of <hi>Zachary</hi> was ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill'd, but by the Succeſſion of this later Feaſt in room of the former? That I mean of <hi>c.</hi> 14.16. <hi>It ſhall come to paſs that every one that is left of all the Nations that come, or ſhall come againſt</hi> Jeruſalem (for ſo it may be
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:97959:10"/>rendred, and is by the <hi>Chaldee, Syriack</hi> and <hi>Arabick;</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the Latin of <hi>Arias Montanus</hi> and the <hi>Tigurin</hi> Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlators, rendred in the preſent or future Tenſe) <hi>ſhall even go up from year to year to worſhip the King, the Lord of Hoſts, and to keep the Feaſt of Tabernacles.</hi> This Prophecy certainly was not fulfill'd by the famous Feaſt of Tabernacles kept in <hi>Nehemia</hi>'s time: See <hi>Nehem. c.</hi> 8. <hi>v.</hi> 14, and 17. For, according to the Law but newly read to the People, they that kept that Feaſt were to be Iſraelites born. See <hi>Levit.</hi> 23.42. when yet of the Paſſover ſtrangers were bound to eat. The Jews themſelves think it was not then fulfill'd; for, as <hi>S. Hierom</hi> on the place ſays, <hi>Haec Judaei caſsâ ſpe in mille annorum Regno futura pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittunt.</hi> That it's only an <hi>Iſraeliſm,</hi> I am not yet perſuaded to think; Whereto give me leave to add, that the Sacrifices of that Feaſt had according to the Jews a peculiar reſpect to the Gentiles. For whereas on the firſt day they Offer'd thirteen Bullocks, on the ſecond twelve, and ſo abated every day one, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that on the ſeventh day there were but ſeven Offer'd, but in the whole Seventy, according to the number of the Nations; This (ſay they) ſignifies the gradual diminution of the Nations, until they ſhould all ſubmit to the Kingdom of the Meſſiah, who was to be the deſire of all Nations. See <hi>Menaſſ. Ben Iſrael Vindic. Jud. p.</hi> 22. <hi>Hoſpin. de Orig. Feſt. Jud. p.</hi> 41.</p>
            <p>How the day of Atonement did Typify that of our Lords Paſſion, though at a different time of the year, I will not now undertake to ſhew, becauſe it is not a Feſtival day, and falls not ſo properly under our conſideration; we will therefore paſs on.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, And now after theſe, why may not the Memories of the Apoſtles be preſerv'd on certain days,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:97959:11"/>whereon, without doing any Worſhip to them, we bleſs God for the excellent Graces and Virtues, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he inabled them to be ſucceſsful Preachers and Champions of the Holy Goſpel; ſo ſucceſsful that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other Nations, We in this Outskirt of the World, in this remote Iſle, heard the joyful Sound, within five years after our Lords Aſcenſion (that is, before <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf) according to <hi>Gildas?</hi> I ſay, why on thoſe days, which God hath made ſo remarkable with the Martyrdoms of the Apoſtles, ſhould we not glorifie God on that behalf? Theſe were accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to St. <hi>Paul (Eph.</hi> 2.20.) the Founders under our Lord, of the Chriſtian Church, and the Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of the ſame according to the Revelation of St. <hi>John,</hi> and the Patriarchs of us Gentiles, by whoſe Miniſtry all the Kingdoms of the World have become the Kingdoms of our Lord and of his Chriſt. Shall the Founders of ſmall Guilds and Fraternities be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd with yearly Celebrities in every City and Country, they that only gave their temporal Goods, which they could not long keep; and ſhall thoſe great Hero's, the Founders of the Ancienteſt, Largeſt and moſt Noble Society (whereof we all boaſt to be Members) that reſiſted unto Blood, and counted not their lives dear, be remembr'd once in the year, to the honor of God, and good Edification of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which are the two great ends of all Religion, and the ends of all the Feſtival Solemnities, which our Church hath thought good to obſerve; which I will but ſhortly ſpeak to, becauſe out of place.</p>
            <p>Firſt, For the Honor of God. It is requiſite, in order to the preſerving of a due ſenſe of God upon our minds, that ſuch days as theſe ſhould often recurre. There is a great deal of ſecret Atheiſm lurks in mens hearts, and would grow more rampant in their lives,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:97959:11"/>were not ſuch days as theſe ſtated and fix'd to put ſome ſtop to their Mad Careir. And doubtleſs, if they were duly obſerv'd, and the horrid deaths of thoſe ſtout Champions often inculcated and well conſider'd on; the Religion for which they ſuffered would appear more true and excellent, and uſeful, than vain Scepticks now think it, and the neglect thereof more dangerous. It hath been obſerved by judicious Travellours, that were it not for the keeping of ſome Holy days, the Chriſtian Religion would be in a manner loſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the poor Greeks and others under the <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh</hi> Dominions; and I am afraid, even among us, who ſhould know better, were not times, as well as places, ſet apart for Divine Worſhip, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People would ſoon Heatheniſe, and thoſe that ſeem now of ſprucer Wits, herd among the Vulgar. Common experience tells us, what is left to every body is done by no body, and what to be done at any time is done at no time, and what to be done any where is done no where. Wherefore the Honor of God is concern'd in keeping up thoſe days that ſtill remain, and reſtoring thoſe that are almoſt loſt.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It is alſo for the good of man, not only upon the account of what hath been already ſaid, but this alſo, that he may have frequent oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities of retiring out of the hurry and tumult of the World, of bethinking himſelf, and conſidering what he is, and ought to be, and hopes to be; of what our Lord hath done for him, and what he expects from him. There is need of ſuch breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing times as theſe, or elſe men would be quite over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm'd with the cares of this World, or habitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in ſin paſt all hopes of recovery.</p>
            <pb n="18" facs="tcp:97959:12"/>
            <p>Sixthly and Laſtly, Upon this Ground of ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Holy-days, becauſe God hath made them ſignal by ſome extraordinary benefit then conferr'd, I think we may ſoon anſwer ſeveral of thoſe little Objections that us'd to be made againſt them. As 1. Why no days for <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Samuel,</hi> or any of the goodly Fellowſhip of the Prophets, as well as for the Glorious company of the Apoſtles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Why? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, though they were excellent Perſons in their times, and are ſtill great examples of Virtue to us, yet they were not, could not be any ways inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental to the Publication and Propagation of that Goſpel, upon which we ground our Faith and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; and from which, as from the beginning of the World, we date all our actions and all our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns. The Prophets Preached for the moſt part to the Jews, and few of them were Martyrs, and they that were, ſuffer'd in a leſs noble cauſe and of leſs concern to the World.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When they ſay the Great <hi>Michael</hi> and all the Angels are Crowded into one day, who ſtill continue to be inſtrumental to our Salvation; and almoſt every one of the Apoſtles hath his diſtinct day of comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration, although their Miniſtry was ſoon over; which ſeems to be no fair diſtribution. It is ſoon Anſwer'd, That the Miniſtration of Angels is inviſible, and we can fix no particulars upon them, but ſuch as are rehearſed upon the greater Feſtivals of our Lords Incarnation, Reſurrection, Aſcenſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That they did not, could not ſuffer Martyrdom, as all the Saints did, whoſe days are kept; and 'twas their Martyrdom that Crown'd both them and the days that bear their names, whereon our Lord inabled them to meet death in the Face, though arm'd with utmoſt Rage and Malice; and verified
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:97959:12"/>and magnified the Chriſtian Cauſe thereby. This was the Lords doing, and not theirs; He made the days and not they, and we keep them to his Glory and not theirs. And therefore when they farther object, the <hi>Sunday</hi> collect gives place to that of the Saints, <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>James</hi> are feign to ſhare one day between them, as alſo <hi>Simon</hi> and <hi>Jude,</hi> and the like; they run upon a fond miſtake, as if we did Worſhip to any of them upon thoſe days, which they could not ſurely have done, had they read the Collects proper for thoſe days.</p>
            <p>It is high time I ſhould now ſay ſomething to the ſecond part of my Text, how a Holy-day is to be kept; <hi>We will rejoyce and be glad therein.</hi> This is that which diſtinguiſhes a Faſt from a Feaſt, and makes the latter more Holy than the former, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that in <hi>Nehem.</hi> 8.9. <hi>This day is Holy unto the Lord your God, mourn not, nor weep,</hi> and <hi>v.</hi> 10. <hi>Go your way, eat the fat, and drink the ſweet, and ſend portions for them for whom nothing is prepar'd, for this day is Holy unto the Lord; neither be ye ſorry, for the joy of the Lord is your ſtrength.</hi> God makes days of joy, and they are Holy to Him; we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſo truly ſay of a day of mourning, of a Faſt-day, This is the day which the Lord hath made; for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, Man made it by his ſin, and on it therefore it is his buſineſs to bewail his ſins, and deprecate the Judgments felt or fear'd upon their account. But when God hath made a day to our hands, a day ſignal for ſome great mercy, let us rejoyce and be glad therein. Rejoyce and be glad therein, but how? Not in Riot and exceſs, and making proviſion for the Fleſh to fulfill the Luſts thereof. No, but let us firſt give Publick thanks to God for the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the day, and then if we have opportunity,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:97959:13"/>let us partake of that Holy Feaſt of the Body and Blood, a Feaſt which he hath not only inſtituted but wonderfully made of himſelf, a Feaſt whoſe name and end is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Thanksgiving. What ſhould we render to the Lord for all his benefits to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, but according to our Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 116.12. <hi>Take the Cup of Salvation, and call upon the name of the Lord.</hi> And then, when we have made a difference between the Holy and the Common day by a more plentiful Table, teſtifie our farther thankfulneſs and due reſentment of Gods Mercy, by works of Mercy and Charity. Faſting doth ſtir up Choler, the hungry are ſoon angry; we find how the Hypocrites in <hi>Eſaias</hi> 58.2. Faſted for ſtrife and debate, and ſmote with the Fiſt of wickedneſs, and exacted all their labours, they brought forth their Bills and Bonds, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as the Seventy have it, whom the Arabick exactly follows, and the Chaldee, Syriack and other Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters agree thereto. Although ſome of our Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val days are the common days of Payment of Rents and Debts, yet we ſhould not exact all our labours, uſe our utmoſt rigor then upon failure: Feaſting uſes to make Men placid and eaſie to be intreated, and is then moſt pleaſing to God, as well as Faſting, when Men deal their bread to the hungry, and cover the naked, and lodge the harbourleſs, when they looſe the bands of wickedneſs, undo the heavy burdens, and let the oppreſſed go free, and break every yoke, moreover reconciling our ſelves to our Enemies, and making up differences between Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, Catechiſing Children, Viſiting the Sick, and all ſuch works of Charity are proper works for a Holy day. I need not tell you how Religious the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:97959:13"/>firſt Chriſtian Emperors were this way, not only in giving, but forgiving, how at Eaſter they ſet all Priſoners at liberty, except Traytors, Murderers, Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhers of Women and ſuch notorious Malefactors. I could tell you how our <hi>Saxon</hi> Laws provided, that no Man ſhould be put to death upon the Lords day, that the Ordeal Tryal ſhould not be undergone upon any Feaſt or Faſt day, and took care for the relief of Priſoners every Lords day. But theſe are things, which no Man will gainſay, and therefore I will paſs on, and come in the laſt place to enquire what are the cauſes of the great and general neglect of theſe days, which the Lord hath made ſo ſignal and worthy to be obſerved. I ſhall touch on three, Superſtition, Profaneneſs and Covetouſneſs.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Superſtition, even the Superſtition of thoſe men that are moſt afraid of, or moſt declame againſt Superſtition, their conceit is no leſs Superſtitious, than their Notation is fond, in making it to be, <hi>Quicquid ſuper ſtatutum,</hi> I would ask them in this caſe, what Statute have they that forbids the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of any other day, beſides the Lords day? 1. If they ſay, God is the Lord of time, and he hath ſaid, Six days ſhalt thou labor— I reply, Thoſe words are no part of the fourth Commandment, I mean, not of it as commanding; but a permiſſion incouraging the Obſervance of the thing command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as if it were ſaid, the Lord allows you ſix days for your own buſineſs, and may therefore more ſtrictly require the ſeventh of you for his own ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; they are no more a Command, than that in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.19. <hi>In the ſweat of thy face ſhalt thou eat bread.</hi> But the practice of the Objectors who have indicted Faſts and Thanksgivings on working days, when and as often as they pleas'd, is Confutation
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:97959:14"/>enough to the Objection. But 2. They urge that to the <hi>Galat.</hi> 4.10. <hi>Ye obſerve days, and months, and times, and years;</hi> I reply again; If the Context, and Scope of the whole Epiſtle did not ſhew it plainly to be written to Judaiſing People; thoſe four words in the Text alledged, would tell us the Apoſtle means the Jewiſh Feſtivals, whereof they had four ſorts. But what is that to us, that keep days in teſtification of our being Chriſtians, and diſclaiming all Judaiſm; and keep them not in imitation of the Jews no more than we do the Sabbath, but rather in order to their invitation and bringing them over to the Chriſtian Faith, and to ſhew that Chriſt is greater than <hi>Moſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the great thing they inſiſt on is, 'Tis againſt Goſpel purity, to have mixtures of Human Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with Divine Injunctions, and this ſuperſtitious conceit is the great cauſe not only of this neglect, but of Schiſm or unlawful Separation.</p>
            <p>Anſ. I have already ſaid, To be thankful for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits is a Law of Nature, and no Human Invention; and to give thanks yearly on thoſe days whereon thoſe Benefits were beſtow'd, rather than any other is ſo Natural, hath ſo great a congruity in it, that the Objectors themſelves chooſe to do ſo. But let them tell me, is there any more of man in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an <hi>Eaſter</hi>-day than a Fifth of <hi>November,</hi> in prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of God for the firſt planting of the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, than a late preſervation of it. But what? Did they never hear of the Feaſt of <hi>Purim,</hi> and that Feaſt of the Dedication, whereat our Lord was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; of the Seven days which King <hi>Solomon</hi> kept at the firſt Dedication of the Altar, and the Seven days that King <hi>Hezekiah</hi> kept at the Feaſt of Unleavened bread over and above what the Law Commanded, 2
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:97959:14"/>
               <hi>Chron.</hi> 30.23. Of the four Faſts in <hi>Zech.</hi> 8.19. whereof but one was injoin'd?</p>
            <p>But, becauſe they call us ſo often to the Pattern in the Mount, we will take a View of that, and ſhew you that the Iſraelites did not only Act <hi>ſuper,</hi> but <hi>contra ſtatutum</hi> in ſeveral things; yet no ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was made from Publick Communion with that Church, and therefore every Imperfection can be no juſt cauſe of Separation, nor every Supererogation. I will give three notorious Inſtances, whereof two concern Feſtivals.</p>
            <p>The Firſt ſhall be touching the Feaſt of Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, whereof we read, Nehem. 8.17. <hi>All the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of them that were come again out of the Captivity made Booths, and ſate under the Booths; for ſince the days of</hi> Joſhua <hi>the Son of</hi> Nun <hi>unto that day had not the Children of Iſrael done ſo;</hi> that is, they had not kept the Feaſt of Tabernacles; at leaſt in that main circumſtance of dwelling in Tents and Booths for a Thouſand years together; and that throughout the moſt flouriſhing time of that Church, although it was expreſly Commanded no leſs than four times in <hi>Moſes.</hi> It is a wonder how it came to paſs that neither <hi>David,</hi> nor <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> nor <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel,</hi> nor <hi>Jehoiadah,</hi> nor any other reforming King, zealous Prieſt, or inſpired Prophet, no anſwer by <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> corrected this neglect in ſo many Ages, in all which time we find no ſeceſſion made from the Church that then was.</p>
            <p>My Second Inſtance ſhall be in a Holy year, the Obſervation whereof is Commanded, Levit. 25.2. <hi>&amp;c. When ye come into the Land which I give you, then ſhall the Land keep a Sabbath unto the Lord, thou ſhalt neither ſow thy Seed, nor prune thy Vineyard,</hi> &amp;c. And now ſee the Omiſſion in the Puniſhment
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:97959:15"/>(threatned, <hi>Levit.</hi> 26.34, &amp;c.) inflicted, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.21. —<hi>untill the Land had injoyed her Sabbaths; for as long as ſhe lay deſolate ſhe kept Sabbath to fulfill threeſcore and ten Years.</hi> So long the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Captivity laſted, that the Land might reſt and lie untill'd ſo many years as the Seventh or Sabbatick year had been unobſerv'd. Reckon and ye will find juſt Seventy ſevens in four hundred ninety years; ſo that for 490 years together they had broken the aforeſaid Law, to wit, from the days of <hi>Samuel</hi> to the Captivity; and yet no Separation all that while.</p>
            <p>My Third Inſtance (tho not ſo near a kin, yet not altogether forreign to our buſineſs) ſhall be of a ſin of Commiſſion againſt a moſt plain and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Command, in <hi>Levit.</hi> 17.3. where 'tis ſaid, <hi>What man ſoever there be of the Houſe of Iſrael, that kills an Ox, or Lamb, or Goat in the Camp, or that killeth it out of the Camp and bringeth it not to the door of the Tabernacle of the Congregation, to Offer an Offering to the Lord before the Tabernacle of the Lord, Blood ſhall be imputed to that man, he hath ſhed Blood, and that man ſhall be cut off from among his People.</hi> The ſame denunciation recurs in the 8 and 9 <hi>ver.</hi> taking in alſo the Sojourner and Stranger. Ye ſee the heinouſneſs of the Offence; It was as bad as Bloodſhed or Murder to offer elſe where. And yet, according to ſome the High Places were fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented ſoon after the days of <hi>Joſhua</hi> and continued till the moſt thorough reformation of <hi>Hezekiah;</hi> and that ſpace makes near upon Seven hundred years: But, it is infallibly certain, that for Three hundred years, to wit, from <hi>Solomon</hi> to <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> they did Sacrifice in High Places. It is ſaid of <hi>Solomon</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, 1 Kings 3.3. Solomon <hi>loved the Lord, walking in the ways of</hi> David <hi>his Father, only he Sacrificed
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:97959:15"/>and burnt Incenſe in high places; and the King went to</hi> Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beon <hi>and Sacrificed there; for that was a great High Place; a Thouſand Burnt-Offerings did</hi> Solomon <hi>offer upon that Altar,</hi> that is, a Thouſand Murders did he Commit there according to the forecited Law; unleſs ye will ſay it was enough to free him from ſuch an imputation that the Tabernacle was there, although the Ark, the Symbol of God's preſence, was at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> So indeed it is in 2 <hi>Chron. c.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 3, 4. I will not diſpute the thing ſo far; it is enough that he ſinned in burning Incenſe either there or in other High Places; of that there need be no doubt. Nor was it his ſin alone, the People did ſo too, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 3.2. Ye cannot think <hi>Rehoboam</hi> and <hi>Abija</hi> diſcontinued thoſe High Places, when ye find it an abatement in the Characters of thoſe two good Kings, <hi>Aſa</hi> and <hi>Jehoſaphat,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 15.14. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.17. and 20.33. that they were not taken away. <hi>Jehoram</hi> was ſo far from removing the old that he made new ones, <hi>c.</hi> 21.11. The ſame exception is made in the Character of <hi>Amaziah,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 14.4. and his Son <hi>Azariah c.</hi> 15.4. and his Son <hi>Jotham, v.</hi> 35. But the High Places were not remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, <hi>&amp;c. Ahaz</hi> exceeded <hi>Jehoram</hi> in multiplying thoſe forbidden Places, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.4, 25. at laſt came reſolute <hi>Hezekiah</hi> and he ſwept them all away. Examin the particular Texts, and ye will find, that to Sacrifice and burn Incenſe in High Places was grown a National Cuſtom; inſomuch that though totally removed by <hi>Hezekiah</hi> they were ſo reſtored by his Son <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> that, notwithſtanding his deep Repentance and earneſt Reformation of all other things, theſe ſtood ſtill, 2. Chron. 33.17. <hi>Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs the People did Sacrifice ſtill in the High Places, yet unto the Lord their God only;</hi> that is, they were great Tranſgreſſors, but not real Idolaters.</p>
            <pb n="26" facs="tcp:97959:16"/>
            <p>Theſe are three great Inſtances of the deviation of that only then true Church from the Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern in the Mount, and yet how many Thouſands of good and holy Men liv'd and died in the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion thereof notwithſtanding. I ſay three great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and I may dare to challenge any Man living to give any one Inſtance of ſo groſs corruption and declenſion from the Commands of our Lord in this our Church of <hi>England.</hi> Surely none will alledge the Omiſſion of the Womens Veil, and the holy Kiſs, the Non-abſtinence from Blood and the like, which yet were Apoſtolical Inſtitutions; for by ſuch Allegations they will accuſe themſelves, and afford more matter of Argument againſt their own Superſtition and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration. But I haſten, and ſay</p>
            <p>Secondly, Profaneneſs is another cauſe of the neglect of the Holy Feſtivals. Too many there are that have a ſecret quarrel againſt all ſerious Religion; howſoever they pretend highly for the preſent eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment; this they do not becauſe it is the beſt, but becauſe it is the preſent, they have not that va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, for what is Relatively Holy, as its Relation to God requires; neither for Perſon, nor Thing, nor Place, nor Time. 1. As for Perſons, they make nothing to miſcall and deride, miſreport and beli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel them unſeen and unheard. Private Perſons uſurp Epiſcopal Authority, and others do <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, ſuperciliouſly mark and fault them that belong not to their Inſpection, and gladly <hi>receive an accuſation againſt an Elder without any witneſſes.</hi> 2. And for Things Sacred, they are ready upon all occaſions to queſtion, diſpute, defalcate and intervert the dues of the Church, as if there were no ſuch ſin as Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilege, and they never heard of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira.</hi> 3. The little eſteem they have for Places is ſoon
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:97959:16"/>found, when you come to crave their Benevolence for the building or repairing of them; they are as ready as <hi>Judas</hi> to ſay, <hi>Quorſum perditio haec?</hi> 4ly. and Laſtly, For Times, all days are alike to them, as appears by their neglect of the Prayers of the Church and other duties proper to them. They are for the Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, but not for the Holy day; for the Mirth, but not for Religion of the time, any farther than to keep their Credit, and ſave their Purſes; and this brings to the</p>
            <p>Third cauſe of the neglect we complain of, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs; under which we deſire not to bring in the Day-labourer that hath as many Mouths to feed, as there are days in the Week to work in, nor the ſweat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Husbandman, who muſt attend the ſeaſons of Plowing and Sowing: But thoſe whoſe Trades and Imployments do allow them fair Intervals and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of attending Divine Worſhip. Theſe care not, though the Church be ſhut, if their Shops may ſtand open; let others ſerve God, they muſt ſerve their Cuſtomers, and mind their Trade; they ſpare not to ſay ſo. There are ('tis well known) few Holy-days in the Year, whereon there are not held ſome Marts and Fairs up and down the Country; That of the Aſcenſion of our Lord not excepted. And there needs no bidding of theſe on the <hi>Sunday</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, nor Bells to toll the People to them; thither they will flock and haſten without taking the Church in their way, tho never ſo near it; there they Buy and Sell, and get gain, it may be only go to ſee and be ſeen; but muſt think of no other God to ſerve, but the great Mammon.</p>
            <p>Whether this Cuſtom was begun by the Pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers that choſe <hi>Sundays</hi> and other Holy-days to vend their Bulls and their Relicks on; and ſo oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioning
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:97959:17"/>great Confluences of People, in proceſs of time Grants were obtain'd to Authoriſe and Perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate thoſe Meetings, which turn'd of themſelves from the ſale of ſeemingly holy to that of really uſeful things: Or whatever were the cauſe, it is certain, if Fairs did not borrow their name from <hi>Feriae,</hi> they have robb'd them in moſt places of the Religion that belongs to them. Thoſe that uſed to be held on the Lords-day have been all ſuppreſs'd or adjourn'd to ſome other day. Which ſhows it poſſible that ſome proviſion may be made for the regulating of the other. But whether Authority will firſt think of a way to reſtore the Revenues alienated from the Church-men, or the Honor, whereof theſe Secular diverſions, have robb'd the Church-days I am not able to Divine.</p>
            <p>In the mean time let us all do what we can in our own ſpheres and capacities to preſerve that va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue and veneration, which is due to all that is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Holy. And firſt of all for that Holineſs, which is real and intrinſec.</p>
            <p>Let us hallow the name of God, and entertain thoughts worthy of ſo Excellent a Majeſty; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming Him whoſe Nature is the very comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of all Adorable Perfection; ſpeak reverently and conſiderately of Him, and to Him. And in all our actions indeavour to be holy as He is Holy. Honor all thoſe that bear upon them any Image of his Holineſs, in whatever unhappy circumſtances they may be.</p>
            <p>And then, whatever is therefore Holy, becauſe it hath a proper Relation to God, and is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:97959:17"/>as it were appropriated to him, let us uſe and behave our ſelves towards the ſame as ſuch. Let us of the holy Function conſider we are taken from among Men, and ſet apart for Divine things; and therefore ought not to make our ſelves Common and Cheap; and free to all Comers and Companies, and Cuſtoms, and Faſhions of the World; ought not to be ſo Complaiſant, as to comply with the ſinful humours, diſcourſes, and exceſſes of thoſe that hate Holineſs in their hearts, and ſhew no more in their lives than needs muſt, or for faſhion ſake. And yet, let it not be thought but that there is an Honor due to the Function it ſelf, where the Perſon is not altogether ſo deſerving; becauſe of the Relation which he ſtands in to God, and the uſefulneſs which he may be of to Man. And for Places, let us Honor them, not by keeping a diſtance from them, but by frequenting them reverently and uſing them to thoſe Holy ends, for which they were at firſt deſign'd. Laſtly, For Times, let us ſanctifie them in like manner, and, while we join with the Church in her Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, poſſeſs our ſelves with a deep ſenſe of the Bleſſing, which we then commemorate, and the weightineſs of that Religion, which conſiſts of ſo many Myſteries, and hath been Confirm'd and Convey'd to us by ſo many Miracles and Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms. Let us conſider there is a Sacrilege belongs to Time as well as Thing; and the Robbery of the former is the more heinous, becauſe it is not ſo eaſie to make Reſtitution; and the more to be avoided becauſe more eaſily committed.</p>
            <p>All this let us practiſe, that we may, and till we do arrive thither, where there will be no Sun
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:97959:18"/>nor Temple (<hi>Rev.</hi> 21. <hi>v.</hi> 22, 23.) diſtinction of Time nor Place, nor Perſons neither; but all ſhall be Kings and Prieſts unto God, and keep an Eternal Sabbath, or day of Holy reſt, World without End. For which Happy and Glorious State God of his Infinite Goodneſs fit us, and then bring us to it, for the ſake of our Bleſſed Lord and Saviour. <hi>Amen.</hi>
